# Home Assistant Add-on: Grafana Tempo

Grafana Tempo is an open source, easy-to-use, and high-scale distributed tracing backend.

## How to use

This add-on really does nothing. It is just an example.

When started it will print the configured message or "Hello world" in the log.

It will also print "All done!" in `/share/example_addon_output.txt` to show
simple example of the usage of `map` in addon config.
